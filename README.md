🦠 Malaria Cells Image Classification
This project focuses on classifying cell images as parasitized or uninfected using deep learning techniques. It aims to assist in the early detection of malaria through automated image analysis, helping reduce manual effort and diagnostic time in medical labs.

🔍 Project Overview
Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted through mosquito bites. Traditional diagnosis methods involve manual inspection of blood smear slides under a microscope, which is time-consuming and prone to human error. This project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automate the classification of cell images into two categories:

Parasitized

Uninfected

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

OpenCV (optional, for preprocessing)

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Dataset
The dataset used is the "Malaria Cell Images Dataset" available on Kaggle, containing over 27,000 cell images labeled as either Parasitized or Uninfected.

⚙️ Key Features
Image preprocessing and augmentation

Deep learning model using CNN architecture

Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Visualization of predictions and training metrics

🚀 Future Enhancements
Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy

Deployment as a web app or mobile interface
